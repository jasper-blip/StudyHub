- **Blood Types:** Karl Landsteiner discovered blood types (e.g., O).
- **Blood Banks:** Large blood banks were developed during World War II by British and US forces. The first was established in 1917 at the **Battle of Cambrai**.
- **Cancer Therapy:** Radiation therapy for cancer was started in 1901.
- **X-rays:** Essential for locating shrapnel, bullets, and broken bones within patients. Developed by **Marie Curie** (mobile units).
- **Thomas Splint:** A device that reduced leg fracture fatality rates from 80% to 20%.
- **Plastic Surgery:** Advanced significantly during WW1, notably by **Harold Gillies**.
- **Underground Hospital:** 1,000-bed facility located in **Arras**.

## Topic: Disease in the Trenches
- **Trench Foot:** Caused by standing in flooded, cold trenches. Can lead to amputation.
- **Disease Vectors:** Lice, rats, and fleas spread illnesses like typhus.
- **Sanitation:** Unclean water and toilets were major factors. Flooding exacerbated spread.
- **Infection Control:** **Carbolic acid** used in bandages. Infection was a primary reason for amputations.

## Topic: Gas Warfare
- **Types:** Lachrimatory (Tear gas), Mustard gas, Chlorine, and Phosgene.
- **Geneva Protocol (1925):** International agreement that outlawed the use of gas weapons.

## Topic: Trench Warfare
- **Battles:** The **Battle of the Somme** (July 1916) was a major event on the Western Front.
- **Strategic Geography:** The German Imperial Army retreated to the **Hindenburg Line** in April 1917. The **Western Front** was primarily in France and Belgium.
- **Construction Spec:** The ideal trench depth was **6-7 feet**.
- **Methods:** 
  - **Sapping:** Digging from the end of the trench.
  - **Tunnelling:** Digging underground (often to plant mines).
  - **Entrenching:** Digging straight down from the surface.
- **Organization:** Trench systems included **Frontline**, **Support** (100m behind frontline), **Reserve**, and **Communication** trenches.
- **Chain of Evacuation:** 
  1. **Regimental Aid Posts (RAP):** Located close to the frontline.
  2. **Dressing Stations:** Located further back for immediate treatment.
  3. **Casualty Clearing Stations (CCS):** First major medical facilities, specialized in surgery.
  4. **Base Hospitals:** Large hospitals near the coast for long-term care or transport home.
- **Field Ambulance:** Transport units within the medical chain (linked to RAMC).

## Topic: Institutions & Society
- **Opposition to Reform:** 
  - **Edward Jenner:** Opposed by the Church and the Anti-Compulsory Vaccination League.
  - **NHS:** Initially opposed by some doctors and public members.
- **Government Response:** In 1832, the government had no effective strategy for cholera.
- **Policy Trends:** Shifted from "laissez-faire" (pre-late 19th c.) to proactive welfare state (influenced by Booth and Rowntree).
- **Smallpox Timeline:**
  - **1802:** Jenner awarded £10,000 for research.
  - **1853:** Vaccination made compulsory in England and Wales.

## Topic: The Church & Science
- **Church Influence:** Forbidden dissection (except executed criminals), hindering anatomical progress.
- **Supernatural Beliefs:** Black Death (1348) was blamed on God's wrath or astrology.
- **Humanism:** Figures like Erasmus challenged supernatural explanations through reason.
- **Medical Evolution:**
  - **Abulcasis (Muslim physician, 11th c.):** Invented multiple surgical instruments and popularised **cauterisation** (burning wounds).
  - **Printing Press (1440):** Facilitated much faster spread of medical knowledge to more people.
  - **Prosthetics:** War drove innovation from Ambroise Paré (16th c.) to modern microprocessor-controlled limbs.
  - **Microscopes (17th c.):** Driven by tech improvement, led to better diagnosis and treatment.

## Topic: Modern Medicine & Attitudes
- **NHS (1948):** Established to provide **free** healthcare; faced early opposition from **Conservatives and doctors**.
- **Change Over Time:** Galen's Theory of Opposites remained influential for nearly two millennia (until the 1800s).

## Topic: Shell Shock
- **Shift in View:** Originally debated as a physical injury, eventually recognized as a mental/psychological trauma.
